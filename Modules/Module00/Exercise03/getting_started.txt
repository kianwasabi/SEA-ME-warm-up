------ Compile Code ------ 
The g++ commands I provided are used to compile and link the C++ source files into an executable program.
First, navigate to your project folder. 
$ cd Module00/Exercise03
Second, compile the phonebook.cpp source file and generates an object file (phonebook.o). 
The -c flag tells g++ to compile the source file without linking. The -o flag specifies the output file name.
$ g++ -c src/phonebook.cpp -o src/phonebook.o
Third, compile the main.cpp source file and generates another object file (main.o).
$ g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o
Then, compiled the object files (phonebook.o and main.o) together into an executable program called phonebook. 
$ g++ src/phonebook.o main.o -o phonebook
After running these commands, you will have an executable file called phonebook, which you can run by executing ./phonebook in the terminal.
$ ./phonebook

The g++ command automatically performs the linking step when object files are provided as input. 
The -o flag specifies the output file name for the executable.
By compiling and linking the source files separately, you can improve compilation times when you make changes to only one of the files. 
Only the modified file needs to be recompiled, and then all the object files can be linked together again to create the updated executable.

------ Terminal Commands ------ 
$ COMMAND {stringstream}
$ ADD {firstname} {lastname} {phonenumer} {nickname}
$ SEARCH {index/all} {value/null}
$ REMOVE {index(phonenumer)} {value/value}
$ BOOKMARK {index} {value}
$ EXIT

------- Test functionalty according to requirments ------ 
IN:                                 OUT (Expected):            OUT (Test):              Comment: 
1) Adding new contacts.
$ ADD Kian Warias 1234 Kian         Contact successfully added.
$ ADD Kian Warias 1234 Kian         Another contact with same phonenumber already exists. 
$ ADD Nika Warias 1234 Nika         Another contact with same phonenumber already exists.
$ ADD Nika Warias 5678 Nika         Contact successfully added.
2) Look through contact list.
$ SEARCH all                        Lists all contacts. 
$ SEARCH index 1                    Shows first contact in vector.
$ SEARCH index 2                    Shows second contact in vector. 
$ SEARCH index 3                    There is no contact with this index. 
3) Toggle bookmark on contacts. 
$ BOOKMARK index 1                  
$ SEARCH index 1                    First contact is bookmarked. 
$ BOOKMARK index 2                  
$ SEARCH index 2                    Second contact is bookmarked. 
$ BOOKMARK index 1                  
$ SEARCH index 1                    First contact is not bookmarked. 
4) Remove contacts. 
$ REMOVE index 1                    First contact removed.                  
$ REMOVE phone number 5678          Second contact removed. 
$ SEARCH all                        
5) Exit Application. 
$ EXIT                              Program has been ended.   Program has been ended.   passed.
