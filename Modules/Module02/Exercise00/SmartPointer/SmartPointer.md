# Module 02
## Exercise 00 : Smart Pointer

> A smart pointer is a class template that provides automatic memory management for dynamically allocated objects. It is a type of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) object that ensures that memory allocated to an object is automatically freed when the smart pointer goes out of scope.
> Expand your Car example to demonstrates how smart pointers can be used in C++ to automate memory management and avoid common problems like memory leaks and dangling pointers.
